INITIATION TWEAKS
=================

The kernel can apply a variety of commands to the initc.txt file to:

-   customise & enhance the invocation of the HCE executable
-   improve compatibility and reliability of the SPV3.2 mode
-   customise SPV3.2 post-processing effects or disabling them
-   provide backward compatibility with SPV3.1 by unlocking the maps

PLAYER AUTO-AIM & MAGNETISM
---------------------------

These two options improve the experience of using a controller,
particularly on SPV3.1 & SPV3.2.

MOUSE ACCELERATION
------------------

Mouse acceleration can be toggled. Having it off may improve accuracy.

GAMMA
-----

Specifying a gamma to the kernel will declare the respective value in
the initiation file. This permits HCE to run at a higher brightness. If
set to 0, then HCE will run at its native brightness.

CINEMATIC BARS
--------------

The kernel can toggle cinematic bars for SPV3.1 or SPV3.2 cutscenes.

MOTION SENSOR
-------------

This is used to show or hide the SPV3.2 motion sensor. Particularly
useful when using the Photo mode in the SPV3 loader.

UNLOAD
------

This option prohibits all post-processing effects from running, by
completely unloading them at start-up. This can drastically improve
performance, and even reliability when running SPV3.2.

SHADERS
-------

SPV3.2 shaders are declared in the initiation file. Refer to the
shaders.txt documentation for further information on this.
