RESETTING
=========

SPV3.2 players may encounter a running HCE process even after quitting
the game. This prevents subsequent HCE processes from being executed. To
work around that, HXE will attempt to kill a running HCE process before
patching and invoking the executable.

The reset attempts will be carried out a maximum of 25 times. This is to
prevent potential infinite loops where the process is never killed,
either due to permission issues or potential bugs.
