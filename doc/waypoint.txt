WAYPOINT "PROFILE NAME" FILE
=================================

The waypoint file contains the path to itself and the file name is the
profile's name with no file extension. HXE does not need this file, but
it can be created so Halo can locate and recognize the relevant profile.

INFERENCE
---------

The location of the waypoint file for the relevant profile can be implicitly
inferred by detecting a player folder and then looking for a file with the same
name within that folder.

ANALYSIS
--------

The path of a profile's waypoint file can be either a full path or relative
path. This path is written to the file encoded as UTF-8 with Windows CR-LF
line endings.

Examples:
    C:\Users\user\Documents\My Games\Halo CE\savegames\<profile name>\<profile name>
    <path parameter>\savegames\<profile name>\<profile name>
    .\profiles\savegames\<profile name>\<profile name>
