EXIT CODES
==========

The CLI process returns various exit codes depending on what causes it
to exit. The following table outlines the available exit codes, and what
they represent:

  Integer   Description
  --------- ---------------------------
  0         Successful execution
  1         Invalid command provided
  3         Invalid argument provided
  7         Exception has been thrown

These codes can be used by calling applications to infer whether an
operation has succeeded or not, and respond accordingly.

For example, if the CLI exits with a code representing an exception
being thrown, then the calling application should display the relevant
logs to the end-user.
