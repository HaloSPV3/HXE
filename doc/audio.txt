AUDIO PATCHES
=============

The HXE kernel is able to patch a detected profile's audio settings for
high audio quality/variety & EAX enabling.

QUALITY
-------

The following audio qualities are set to their highest levels:

-   Quality
-   Variety

ENHANCEMENTS
------------

The kernel, if configured, will enable Hardware Acceleration and
Environmental Audio in the detected profile.

Defensively, the kernel will refuse to enable HWA & EAX and explicitly
disable them if the DSOAL library is not present in the executable's
working directory.

If the kernel is not configured to patch the audio enhancements, then it
won't do anything, regardless of the presence of the DSOAL library.
