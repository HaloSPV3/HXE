## Getting Started
Normally, one would simply `git clone` this repository and get to work, but–because it would be security vulnerability–we can't make Git automatically set up guardrails like [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) and Commitizen to ensure automated semantic versioning, releases, and pull requests continue to function as intended. <br/>

However, we want the learning curve to be as quick and easy as possible. 

We also cannot force you to to use specialized wrappers for Git given our development workflow most often uses Visual Studio 2019 and up. 

### TODO
- Post-Clone, manually executed setup script. Sets up the following:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (script dependency)
  - [convetional-changelog/commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
  - [commitizen/cz-cli](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
