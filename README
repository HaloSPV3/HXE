HALO XE (HXE)
=============

What is it? In a nutshell, it's...

-   a fully compatible wrapper around HCE that automatically enhances
    its video and audio properties;

-   a loader for SPV3 that allows installation/updates, post-processing
    configuration, and campaign resuming;

-   a library for developers to programmatically manipulate HCE files
    such as the player's profile or load HCE.

How do you use it? You can...

-   double click on it to automatically run HCE with the video and audio
    enhancements;

-   seamlessly pass HCE parameters such as -window, -vidmode, -adapter
    and -console;

-   import it into your .NET project and use it to detect and edit
    player profiles, or load HCE programmatically;

-   compile your mod into redistributable packages that people can
    install to their system.
