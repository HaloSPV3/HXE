THE SPV3 CLI
============

This repository contains the source for the SPV3 CLI, which seeks to
unify the compiling, installing, configuring, and loading procedures for
SPV3. The code and documentation here should be considered as the
official sources for the binaries that will be distributed with SPV3.2.

Current features include:

-   LOADING

    -   automatic HCE/SPV3 player profile detection
    -   automatic resuming of the SPV3 campaign progress
    -   automatic detection & launching the HCE executable
    -   verification of the SPV3 assets/maps/executables

-   COMPILING

    -   compressing SPV3 data to re-distributable packages
    -   generating a manifest for the installer & loader

-   INSTALLING

    -   (re)installing compressed packages to the filesystem
    -   storing the chosen installation path in a standard file

USAGE
-----

The USAGE document goes into detail on how to use the SPV3 CLI. In a
nutshell:

    .\SPV3.exe                     # verifies, resumes & runs SPV3
    .\SPV3.exe compile "src" "dst" # compiles data from src to dst
    .\SPV3.exe install "src" "dst" # installs data from src to dst

    .\SPV3.exe placeholder commit "plc" "dst" "flt"
                                    |     |     |
      path for placeholder bitmap - +     |     |
      absolute path to bmp folder ------- +     |
      filter, e.g. *.nrml*.bitmap ------------- +

    .\SPV3.exe placeholder revert "rcd"
                                    |
         path to the records file - +

In the above examples, "src" and "dst" are absolute paths to the
relevant folders on the filesystem.
