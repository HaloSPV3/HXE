USAGE
-----

The USAGE document goes into detail on how to use the SPV3 CLI. In a
nutshell:

    .\SPV3.exe                     # verifies, resumes & runs SPV3

    .\SPV3.exe dump overrides      # writes overrides xml template
    .\SPV3.exe dump opensauce      # writes opensauce xml template
    .\SPV3.exe compile "dst"       # compile current folder to dst
    .\SPV3.exe install "dst"       # installs packages data to dst

    .\SPV3.exe placeholder commit "plc" "dst" "flt"
                                    |     |     |
      path for placeholder bitmap - +     |     |
      absolute path to bmp folder ------- +     |
      filter, e.g. *.nrml*.bitmap ------------- +

    .\SPV3.exe placeholder revert "rcd"
                                    |
         path to the records file - +

In the above examples, "src" and "dst" are absolute paths to the
relevant folders on the filesystem.
